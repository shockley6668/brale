**Brale** is a quantitative strategy generator with AI decision-making at its core. Instead of holding funds directly, it acts as a "Super Brain," utilizing multiple agents (Technical Indicators, Pattern Recognition, Trend Analysis) to collaboratively analyze the market. It ultimately generates decision signals via an LLM (Large Language Model) provider and executes trades securely through the powerful [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) engine.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Abandons traditional hard-coded logic in favor of LLM-based comprehensive analysis of multi-dimensional data, thinking like a human trader.
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
  - **Technical Agent**: Calculates hard indicators like EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR.
  - **Pattern Agent**: Identifies candlestick patterns (e.g., Head and Shoulders, Engulfing).
  - **Trend Agent**: Combines Multi-timeframe analysis to determine the broader trend.
- 🛡️ **Standing on the Shoulders of Giants**: Seamless integration with **Freqtrade**. You focus on strategy signals, while Freqtrade handles position management, stop-loss/take-profit, and exchange connectivity.
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Core logic written in Go, handling concurrent data fetching and indicator calculation for multiple coins.
- 📊 **Visualization & Explainability**: Generates charts and natural language analysis reports, letting you understand *why* the AI decided to open a trade.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture](doc/Reasoning-Edition.png)

1.  **Data Acquisition**: Fetches K-line data from exchanges like Binance.
2.  **Analysis**: Splits data into multiple timeframes and delegates it to Technical, Pattern, and Trend Agents for collaborative analysis.
3.  **Decision**: Aggregates Agent conclusions and generates a final decision via a Provider (e.g., LLM).
4.  **Execution**: Strategy signals are aggregated by weight and sent to Freqtrade for execution.

## ⚠️ Financial Disclaimer

**Brale is an open-source tool for algorithmic trading research and development. It is NOT financial advice. Trading cryptocurrencies is highly speculative and carries a high level of risk. You could lose some or all of your invested capital. You should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Use Brale at your own risk.**

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

### 1. Configuration

```bash
# Copy configuration templates
cp configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.yaml
cp configs/user_data/freqtrade-config.example.json configs/user_data/freqtrade-config.json

# Notes:
# 1. Fill in your LLM API Key in configs/config.yaml
# 2. Configure Exchange API in configs/user_data/freqtrade-config.json (or use dry-run mode)
# 3. Update [ai.multi_agent], [ai.provider_preference], and profile parameters in config.yaml/profiles.yaml as needed.
# 4. Ensure [freqtrade.username] and [freqtrade.password] in config.yaml match [api_server.username] and [api_server.password] in freqtrade-config.json.
# 5. To enable Telegram notifications: Set [telegram.enabled] in freqtrade-config.json AND [notify.telegram.enabled] in config.yaml to true, then fill in the token and chat_id.
```

#### 1.1 Proxy Access
```bash
# 1. If using a proxy, enable [market.sources.proxy.enabled] in config.yaml and fill in your HTTP/SOCKS5 links.
# 2. Uncomment the proxy environment variables in docker-compose.yml (for both freqtrade and brale services) and set HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY to your local port.
# 3. Update [exchange.ccxt_config.proxies] and [exchange.ccxt_async_config.aiohttp_proxy] in freqtrade-config.json with your local port (copy these fields to your active config if needed).
```

### 2. Start Services

Recommended: Use the Make command for a one-click start (cleans environment, prepares directories, and starts services in order):

```bash
make start
```

Or manual steps:

```bash
# 1. Prepare data directories
make prepare-dirs

# 2. Start Freqtrade (must be started first)
BRALE_DATA_ROOT=running_log/brale_data FREQTRADE_USERDATA_ROOT=running_log/freqtrade_data docker compose up -d freqtrade

# 3. Start Brale
BRALE_DATA_ROOT=running_log/brale_data FREQTRADE_USERDATA_ROOT=running_log/freqtrade_data docker compose up -d brale
```

### 3. Verification

```bash
# View logs
make logs

# Health check
curl http://localhost:9991/healthz
```

## 🔌 Execution Layer (Pluggable)

Brale executes trades through a pluggable executor abstraction. The default implementation uses [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade), but nothing in the core logic is tied to it:

- Set `freqtrade.enabled` to `false` in `configs/config.yaml` if you only want signal generation or plan to supply your own executor.
- The executor interface lives in `internal/gateway/freqtrade/executor.go` and defines the full contract (position sync, plan events, manual tier updates, etc.). Any implementation that satisfies this interface can be injected.
- Plug in a custom executor by implementing that interface (e.g., for a different trading engine or proprietary broker), then provide it via `app.WithFreqManager(...)` or your own `buildFreqManager` replacement.
- Because the agent/plan scheduler components communicate only through the interface, you can reuse exit-plan logic, plan scheduler, Telegram notifications, and monitoring with a new executor without changing the AI or pipeline layers.

## 🧩 Indicator System

Brale uses `go-talib` to calculate multi-dimensional technical indicators, automatically adjusting based on configuration:

- **Trend**: EMA (21/50/200), MACD (bullish/bearish/flat)
- **Momentum**: RSI (overbought/oversold), ROC, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R
- **Volatility**: ATR (for dynamic stop-loss or slippage estimation)
- **Volume**: OBV (combined with ROC for volume-price resonance)
